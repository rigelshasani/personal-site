# Image Optimization Test

This post demonstrates the new Next.js Image optimization features.

## Regular Markdown Image
Here's a regular markdown image that will now be optimized:

![Test Image](https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=1)

## Custom Figure Component
And here's the same image using our custom Figure component:

<Figure 
  src="https://picsum.photos/800/600?random=1" 
  alt="Test Figure Component" 
  caption="This image uses the optimized Figure component"
  align="center"
/>

## Different Sizes

Large image:

You should notice:
- Blur placeholders while images load
- WebP/AVIF format conversion for better compression
- Responsive sizing based on screen size
- Lazy loading for images below the fold

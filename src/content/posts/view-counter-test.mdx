# Testing View Counter

This post is designed to test our new view counting system. When you visit this page, it should track your view after 3 seconds and display it in various locations.

## How the View Counter Works

The view counting system is completely anonymous and privacy-focused:

- **No personal data** is collected
- **localStorage** is used to track counts
- **Every visit counts** - shows genuine interest when someone returns
- **5-second delay** before counting to ensure genuine engagement

## Beautiful Test Image

Here's a test image to make this post more visually appealing:

## Where You'll See View Counts

After visiting this page, you should see view counts in:

1. **This page's metadata** (below the title)
2. **Homepage post listings** (if this appears there)
3. **Posts page listings** 
4. **Popular posts section** (once it has some views)

## More Test Content

Let's add some more content to make this feel like a real post:

The view counter is designed to be:
- **Fast** - doesn't slow down page loads
- **Reliable** - works even if localStorage is limited
- **User-friendly** - shows formatted counts (1k, 1.2M, etc.)

Go ahead and test it:
1. **Stay on this page for 5+ seconds** → watch for the green notification popup!
2. **See the view count animate** → turns green, scales up, shows "+1"
3. **Go to homepage and come back** → count increases again with animation
4. **Refresh this page** → count increases again with visual feedback
5. **Every genuine visit counts and shows visually!**
